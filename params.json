Via the public-facing part of the application, users will be able to view the availability for a certain room, request access to that room on the fly (in addition to using their existing Exchange system to reserve the room), and see suggestions of other open rooms. \r\n\r\n**NOTE: This project is still in very early development, so it is subject to some very drastic, and potentially backwards-incompatible changes during the process.**\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Django\r\n\r\nFor information on how to install Django, see their documentation.
